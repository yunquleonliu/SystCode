# Problem 49: Bootloader Logic

## Description
Simulate loading a kernel from disk to memory and jumping to entry.

## Learning Objectives
- **Concepts**: A20 Line, Segment Registers, 16-bit to 32-bit switch

## Implementation Guide
1. **Understand Layout**: Review how this component works in a real system.
2. **Define Structures**: Create the `struct` needed.
3. **Core Logic**: Implement the algorithm.
4. **Edge Cases**: Handle memory boundaries, overflows, or concurrency.

## Testing Strategy
- Verify fundamental correctness.
- Test boundary conditions.
- (If applicable) Performance benchmark.

## Pseudocode Hint
```text
// Add high-level logic here
```


## Why This Problem Matters
- **Bootloader Logic** appears in real systems as a building block for reliability, performance, or scalability.
- Mastering this problem improves your ability to reason about low-level tradeoffs under constraints.

## Step-by-Step Tutoring Guide
1. **Model first**: define invariants and expected state transitions before coding.
2. **Minimal baseline**: implement the simplest correct path.
3. **Harden edges**: handle boundary inputs, error propagation, and cleanup paths.
4. **Optimize last**: tune only after tests prove behavior.

## Common Pitfalls
- Treating happy-path correctness as enough.
- Missing ownership/lifetime rules for memory or resources.
- Ignoring concurrent access patterns and race windows.
- Over-optimizing without measurements.

## Debug & Validation Checklist
- Verify invariants after every major operation.
- Add targeted tests for boundary and stress cases.
- Inspect failure paths as carefully as success paths.
- Confirm complexity/latency assumptions with simple measurements.

## Further Practice
1. Implement a second variant with a different tradeoff (speed vs clarity).
2. Add instrumentation counters for visibility.
3. Document one production-style failure mode and mitigation.

## Solution Summary
The bootloader logic loads the kernel from disk into memory and transfers control to it. Written in assembly for the boot sector, it uses BIOS interrupts to read disk sectors, relocates the kernel to the correct memory address, sets up minimal CPU state (stack, segment registers), and jumps to the kernel entry point.
